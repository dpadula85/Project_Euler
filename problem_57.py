#It is possible to show that the square root of two can be expressed as an
#infinite continued fraction.
#
#âˆš 2 = 1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + ... ))) = 1.414213...
#
#By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get:
#
#1 + 1/2 = 3/2 = 1.5
#1 + 1/(2 + 1/2) = 7/5 = 1.4
#1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2)) = 17/12 = 1.41666...
#1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2))) = 41/29 = 1.41379...
#
#The next three expansions are 99/70, 239/169, and 577/408, but the eighth
#expansion, 1393/985, is the first example where the number of digits in the
#numerator exceeds the number of digits in the denominator.
#
#In the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions contain a numerator
#with more digits than denominator?
