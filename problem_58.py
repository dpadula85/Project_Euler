#Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square
#spiral with side length 7 is formed.

#It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right
#diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying
#along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.
#
#If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral
#with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the
#side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both
#diagonals first falls below 10%?
#
#Ulam Spiral diagonal numbers already treated in problem 28.
#Rearrange the problem to solve this one.
